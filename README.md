IMPORTANT NOTE: 
The HTML of the Fisch wiki will be altered with new updates to the game. 
This may break the code, and require a revision. 
For example, changing "Mythic" to "Mythical" would cause all Mythic fish to disappear from the program.

P.S. you don't need to download site.txt, the program will create this file in the same directory as FischFinderGui.java automatically.
